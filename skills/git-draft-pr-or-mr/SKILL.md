# Git Draft PR Or MR

Use this skill to draft the requested PR or MR title, description, or both from the actual git diff between an explicit base ref and `HEAD`, with a concise change summary and only the technical detail needed for precise review.

## Core Rules

1. Require an explicit base branch or base ref. If the user does not specify one, ask first instead of inferring.
2. Load and follow [../_shared/git-remote-base-resolution.md](../_shared/git-remote-base-resolution.md) before diffing against any base branch or base ref.
3. Base the title and description on the real change set. Use commit messages only as secondary evidence.
4. Prefer concise change framing over long business narration. Lead with the dominant change set, and include only the technical detail needed for precision, review, or release awareness.
5. State the exact base ref used whenever it matters, especially when the user names a branch such as `dev`, `main`, or `master` without clarifying whether they mean local or remote-tracking.
6. Produce one strong recommendation, not multiple equally vague options, unless the user explicitly asks for alternatives.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the base ref.
   - Use the shared remote-base rule to resolve local vs remote-tracking refs, fetch the latest remote base by default, handle explicit downgrade, and record the base commit SHA.
   - Verify the resolved ref before drafting. If the remote-tracking ref is missing or ambiguous, stop instead of using a same-name local branch.
   - If the base is missing, stop and ask for it.

2. Inspect the real change set.
   - Prefer `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` for commit context.
   - Prefer `git diff --stat <base>...HEAD` for size and hotspot context.
   - Prefer `git diff <base>...HEAD` for behavioral changes.
   - Read the relevant committed content at `HEAD` and the comparison base when needed to explain the change. Inspect workspace status before using working-tree files as supporting evidence.
   - Keep uncommitted changes separate from the branch draft. Do not attribute workspace-only behavior, documentation, or validation results to `HEAD`. If the user requests a draft that includes planned or uncommitted work, label that scope explicitly without staging or committing it.

3. Identify the dominant story.
   - Summarize the dominant change set in a few direct points rather than a long background narrative.
   - Call out only important guardrails, compatibility constraints, or contract changes.
   - Separate core changes from supporting tests, cleanup, or enabling implementation details.

4. Draft the title when requested.
   - Keep it short, concrete, and Chinese by default; keep technical terms in English when clearer.
   - Prefer Conventional Commits-style PR titles by default, using `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` when scope adds signal. If the target repo clearly uses a different PR title convention, follow that convention instead.
   - Name the concrete change and its evidenced result. Use a user-visible outcome when the diff supports one. For refactoring, maintenance, tests, CI, or documentation, name the technical change directly. Do not imply new functionality, performance gains, or defect fixes solely to make the title sound outcome-oriented.
   - Avoid vague titles such as “优化一些逻辑” or “修复问题”.

5. Draft the requested description.
   - If the user requests only a title, return the title with the required base context; do not generate a description.
   - Inspect applicable repository PR/MR templates and contribution instructions. Follow the user's requested structure first, then applicable repository requirements. Read [references/output-template.md](./references/output-template.md) for the remaining default shape.
   - Default to a concise summary centered on what changed.
   - Include technical details only when they explain scope, constraints, compatibility, or implementation choices that reviewers need to know.
   - Do not include sections such as “背景”“业务价值”“验证” unless the user explicitly asks for them, applicable repository requirements call for them, or the context clearly requires them.
   - Keep the description faithful to the diff. Do not promise behavior that is not evidenced.

## Output Rules

- Include the exact base ref used near the top when returning the draft.
- Include the base freshness fields required by the shared remote-base rule.
- Mention verification when the user asks for it, applicable repository requirements call for it, or omitting it would hide an important risk. Report only evidenced results; a template does not establish that checks ran or passed.
- If the branch includes unrelated commits or mixed concerns, say so and draft the description around the actual combined scope rather than pretending the change is narrower.
- If the user asks for “PR” or “MR”, treat the artifact shape as the same unless the target platform requires a specific term.

## References

- Read [references/output-template.md](./references/output-template.md) when its default description structure is needed; user and applicable repository requirements take precedence.
